             <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>

<p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript</p>

             <p>A puppy is a juvenile dog. Some puppies can weigh 1–1.5 kg (1-3 lb), while larger ones can weigh up to 7–11 kg (15-23 lb). </p>
             <p>All healthy puppies grow quickly after birth. A puppy's coat color may change as the puppy grows older, as is commonly seen in breeds such as the Yorkshire Terrier. </p>

             <h3><em>CSS Is Apparently a Thing</em></h3>
             <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics.</p>
               <p>Enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript

          <h3><em>Boy Likes Turtles</em></h3>
          <p>The year was 2007 and a ten-year-old boy with a zombie face-paint job was asked by a news reporter in Portland if he liked his new look, his response was: ‘I like turtles’. Those three unexpected words have gone on to attract more than 53 million views on YouTube.</p>
          <p>Well, you might be pleased (or worried) to know he’s all grown up, and Jonathan Ware is now back in the world of YouTube as a gamer… who still seems to be obsessed with turtles.In his first video he describes himself as a teen with ‘really bad hair’ and’ an annoying voice’. But we’ll always remember him as the zombie kid who wanted to share with the world his undying love for turtles</p>
